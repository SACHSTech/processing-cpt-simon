Objective
Barry's Adventure is an engaging and action-packed game where the player controls Barry, a platypus on a mission to navigate through a dangerous laboratory filled with enemies. The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding or defeating enemies and maintaining Barry's health.

Gameplay Mechanics
Movement
Barry: Use the left and right arrow keys to move Barry across the screen. Barry can move left and right, and his position is bounded by the edges of the screen.
Enemies: Barry encounters various enemies, including Sister and Suzie characters, who move towards him and attack when in close proximity.
Actions
Kick: Press the 'K' key to make Barry perform a kick. Kicking is an offensive action used to defeat enemies that come into contact with Barry.
Chop: Press the 'C' key to make Barry perform a chop. This is another offensive move to fend off enemies.
Enemy Behavior
Sister: These enemies walk towards Barry and punch him when close enough. They appear randomly from either the left or right side of the screen.
Suzie: These enemies also move towards Barry and attack by biting him. They too spawn from either side of the screen randomly.
Scoring and Lives
Lives: Barry starts with 5 lives. Each time an enemy successfully attacks Barry, he loses a life. Barry is invincible for a short duration after being hit, indicated by a counter.
Game Over: The game ends when Barry's lives are depleted. A game over screen is displayed, allowing the player to restart the game or return to the main menu.
Limitations
Single Level: The game currently has only one level with no progression to higher difficulty or new environments.
Fixed Enemy Types: The enemies are limited to Sister and Suzie characters with predefined behaviors.
Limited Controls: The game controls are basic, limited to moving left, right, and performing two types of attacks (kick and chop).
No Scoring System: The game does not have a point-based scoring system. Player performance is measured by how long Barry can survive.
